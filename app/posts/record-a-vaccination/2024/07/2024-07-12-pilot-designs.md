We ran an initial pilot of the service with 3 NHS Trusts in June 2024.

This pilot used a minimum viable set of features, aiming to learn from real-world usage of the service.

This page documents the design of the pilot service.

## Signing in

The sign-in flow used a 3rd party authentication service called [Okta](https://www.okta.com).

## Finding a patient

There were 3 ways to look up a patient: by NHS number, searching the national record using demographic data, or searching for patients added to the service locally.

###  By NHS Number

## Patient details

Once found (or added), the patient details page had a 'Choose vaccines' button, leading to the flow for recording a vaccination.

## Recording a vaccination

The details of the vaccination were collected over 4 pages, followed by a 'check and confirm' page.
