As part of the service's expanding scope to help deliver a wider number of vaccines, we 
assessed how RAVS could support maternity vaccines. 

As with all vaccines, there are specific data points that all point of care systems have to record, like the patient’s name, and the vaccine product and batch that has been administered to them.

We identified what specific maternity vaccine-related data RAVS would need to record, determining what data should be flowed nationally, and how we might want to incorporate this into our designs.

We updated the 'record a vaccination' journey to record maternity vaccine data. Specifically, on the following pages (see screenshots):

- Assess the patient
- Vaccinate
- Check and confirm
- Choose vaccine

We incorporated the following changes:

- Preset eligibility to 'pregnancy' when a maternity vaccine was selected
- Collected the ‘expected due date’, when pregnancy was selected as the eligibility
- Preset the legal mechanism as ‘Patient Group Directions (PGD)’

We engaged with the clinical safety and clinical strategy team throughout and tested our designs with maternity users. This helped us to better understand maternity users’ daily processes and to ensure maternity vaccinations were safely and efficiently recorded in RAVS.

User feedback was mainly positive, owing largely to the limited changes. However, we’ll continue to assess user's needs for future iterations.
