## Testing the record a vaccination journey

We're close to releasing our minimal viable service into beta with hospital hubs.

To understand if the 'record a vaccination' user journey continues to meet user needs, we prototyped and ran research sessions with 6 hospital hub participants.

### Patient record

The screen includes key patient identifiers users expect to view to check in patients.

Users also expect the vaccination history to span at least 18 months to cover patients vaccinated early in the season and recognise the editable records listed in the history are those previously recorded in RAVS.

### Choosing vaccines

Once users select a vaccine, they are presented with a more comprehensive list of COVID-19 vaccine products. Users appreciated that they were only shown the information as and when required and navigated through the selection process easily.

We also presented a warning message if the patient was not ready to have another dose of the vaccine, which users found beneficial.

Users recognised the ‘other’ option would be suitable if a vaccine was not included in the list (but in stock).

### Assessing the patient

In response to clinical feedback, we removed the original eligibility questions from this screen. This information was useful to capture during the pandemic but is less relevant now.

Despite the simplified approach, users need a way to capture patient responses to report on groups of eligible, vaccinated patients. Therefore, we will reintroduce the questions.

Most users recognised clinicians' details can be found using a progressive search, and their preference was to ensure this information persisted throughout the clinic.

Users also expected the journey to end if the patient did not receive the vaccine.

### Recording consent

Overall, this screen aligns with users’ expectations.

However, the question ‘Does the patient consent to the vaccination?’ should reflect that someone can consent on behalf of the patient. For example, a person with power of attorney or a clinician acting in the patient’s best interests.

Users also expect to capture the details of the person consenting to the vaccination and the journey to end if consent is not given.

### Recording vaccination details

Users moved through this screen quickly but highlighted areas we must consider.

- Capturing the reason for the patient not being vaccinated and why.
- Clarifying that the vaccine batch should be selected (not the vaccine)
- Building more friction into changing the dose volume to prevent user errors. The volume is typically a standard measure and unlikely to change.

### Checking and confirming the patient's details

Users found reviewing, checking and confirming the vaccination details practical before saving the record.

However, they highlighted a notable omission: the prescribing method or legal means for giving the vaccine.

We learned the vaccine determines the method, and how the organisation plans to run its vaccination clinics. We will iterate our designs to include the ability for users to select and record the method during the journey.
