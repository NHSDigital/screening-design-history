### The service will enable healthcare professionals to record vaccination data safely and efficiently.

Over the last eight months, we have been working to understand what the future of [point of care (PoC)] (https://digital.nhs.uk/coronavirus/vaccinations/training-and-onboarding/point-of-care) should look like and how we can transform the current PoC market to deliver key NHS outcomes better and meet the needs of clinicians and patients.

### Current challenges

Throughout our work, we've found reoccurring challenges faced by users of services within the current PoC market.

- Users who record data when administering Covid-19 and Flu vaccinations together often find the process complicated and time-consuming.
- Clinicians typically have to navigate multiple systems to join up and record patient booking and demographic data into their POC systems
- Poor service usability is leading to data errors and clinical risk for patients

We've also found that the PoC services do not enable the delivery of strategic NHS outcomes such as improving the timeliness of data across [section 7a vaccinations] (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-health-commissioning-in-the-nhs-2021-to-2022/annex-a-public-health-functions-section-7a-agreement-2021-to-2022-services-to-be-provided) and driving more effective patient intervention and vaccine uptake.

And we know that adding new types of vaccine, eligibility questions and making PoC changes can often be time-consuming and burdensome and removes the agility needed to respond rapidly to developing situations.

### Strategic priorities
The future of PoC provision will need to enable the delivery of strategic outcomes such as increasing vaccine uptake and improving the timeliness of patient interventions. The services within the market will need to be able to fulfil these organisational priorities and respond to outbreak or surge situations.

### Record a vaccination
One of the key recommendations was to develop an in-house PoC service. We've called it 'Record a vaccination'. The service will support healthcare settings to safely and efficiently record current vaccinations.

We aim to:

- Deliver an exceptional user experience
- Improve data quality and reduce clinical risk
- Integrate with other systems for more consistent data and an efficient process
- Support the administration and recording section 7a vaccinations
- Drive an increase in PoC service standards throughout the market

### We’re starting to build the service
As we begin our beta (or build) phase, we want to document and share the learnings we have had throughout our work and the progress we will make going forward.

Our design history will show how the service we are developing has been validated through user research across delivery models and will lead to a better point-of-care experience for all users.
