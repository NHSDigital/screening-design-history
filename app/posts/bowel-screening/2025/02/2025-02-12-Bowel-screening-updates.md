What’s been going on in the world of bowel screening for the past few weeks:

## Prioritization of work in bowel screening

Our service designer Ben has been working really closely with our product colleagues to try and understand the various potential pieces of work that are currently floating about and figure out a ay to prioritise these so we will hopefully have an interesting roadmap soon with lots of good chunks of work coming our way!!

## Modernisation of the bowel cancer screening system (BCSS)

The modernisation work is still in set up mode, this week there was a workshop hosted down in Exeter where the team looked at a few things such as who we think the users are and what the vision of the modernisation work is.

## Request a new or replacement FIT kit work

We have started mapping out some very early on journeys, storyboards and process maps for how the request a kit service could work. There is a workshop this Thursday with programme stakeholders where we will go over what our initial thoughts are and hopefully get some feedback from them as to whether this piece of work is really a priority. We also need to start some early conversations with our technical colleagues, BCSS is a very old legacy system and there will potentially be some interoperability issues and considerations for us be aware of.

## Subject search functionality

We have been asked to look a the “subject search” functionality on BCSS (before modernisation) and consider how this can be improved for users. There are currently a few known painpoints that we are aware of for when staff are looking up subjects within BCSS that we could look to resolve, however any major UI changes to the system could come with problems due to the age of it so we will be working with the devs to understand what is and isn’t possible.
